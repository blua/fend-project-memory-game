## Instructions

You can turn two cards per move - if they match, the symbol will remain visible, but if they don't match you have 0.6 seconds to try to memorize them, to use that knowledge in the following moves. Your goal is to get all 16 cards to remain visible.

Find all the pairs in 14 moves or less to get a 3-star rating.

If you are unable to finish the game in 10 minutes, it will expire and you'll have to start a new one.
